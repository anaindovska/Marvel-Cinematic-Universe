                    <p class="right">CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER is something of an extended introduction to the MCU.
                     The bulk of the movie is set in the 40s, and it introduces viewers to the SSR, which becomes S.H.I.E.L.D. Even the end-credits sequence, which features Nick Fury, is a nice setup for everything that will follow.</p>

                    <p class="left">CAPTAIN MARVEL effectively takes the spot formerly held by IRON MAN as the proper kickoff for the entire MCU. 
                          The story is primarily set in the mid-'90s and features the first evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. and an important stage of Nick Fury's career. 
                          The story also sets up the Kree (later seen in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) and, most importantly, deals with an object that becomes significant toward the end of Marvel’s Phase One. 
                          As the origin story for Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), this also feels more like a Phase One movie than anything Marvel has done in the past few years. 
                          In terms of tone and theme, it sits well in the beginning of the viewing order. 
                          Yes, there’s a connection to INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME, but just keep this film’s first post-credits sequence in your back pocket for later.</p>

                        We know who Howard Stark is thanks to THE FIRST AVENGER. Watching his son take his first faltering steps into the “bigger universe” is an effective stage of the MCU movie order. 
                        The final scene, with Nick Fury stepping out of the shadows, will take on a subtly different meaning after the events of CAPTAIN MARVEL. 
                        Rather than hint at the birth of the MCU, it will become connective tissue linking the first three films together.</p>

                        It also features Nick Fury in a far more significant role, allowing viewers to get a sense of just who this figure really is. 
                        Meanwhile, the focus on Howard Stark’s legacy continues to draw the narrative threads together. 
                        It makes perfect sense to watch IRON MAN 2 at this point.

                         Loki returns as a villain; the concept of the Tesseract is explored; and the existence of dangerous alien beings becomes public knowledge when the Chitauri invade New York. 
                         There’s also a more subtle detail as this is the first film to really hint that S.H.I.E.L.D. isn’t just “good guys.” 
                        THE AVENGERS includes a disturbing sequence in which the World Security Council orders a nuclear attack on American soil.

                        That works particularly well when you consider that, according to screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the snap was originally in ENDGAME. 
                        These two films may not be a traditional Parts I and II anymore, but their relationship is so close that it’s better to watch them back to back — just how they were filmed.

                        The fourth AVENGERS movie is very much the culmination of 10 years of story — it is deeply tied to everything that came before, particularly the first three AVENGERS movies. 
                        (That’s a hint about which movies you should definitely rewatch, if you only have time for a handful.) 
                        The story ties up a handful of plot threads that began in several previous movies and opens up new dimensions for future MCU movies to explore.
